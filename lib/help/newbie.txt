===================== Gameplay basics:  The Novice's Guide =====================


NOTE:   In the unlikely event that you are using the roguelike keyset and still 
feel the need for a walkthrough, please review the list of commands (in the help 
file "cmdlist.txt"), as all commands mentioned are those of the original keyset.


     When you (we shall use the second person from now on) begin the game, you 
start out in a town with stores happy to sell you whatever they stock and you 
can afford.  The town is also populated; stay away from rogues and Battle-
scarred Veterans.  Visit the stores and stop by your very own home (the symbol 
'8'), where you can safely stash all sorts of useful gear for later use.
     You are carrying a few objects, which go in logical places on your person
(your equipment) or in your backpack (your inventory).  Look at your 
'i'nventory by typing 'i', and you will see a few items appropriate to your 
character class.  If you have armor, 'w'ear it, if you have a spellbook, 
'b'rowse it, and 'w'ield any weapons and bows you have.  After you have done
this, look at your 'e'quipment by typing 'e', and check out the places that 
gear can fit into.

     Look at the left side of the screen, where all the most important info
about you is displayed.  Reading from the top, you'll see your race, class,
present title, then your experience level, experience points, and money on
hand.  Your race and class never change, but you can gain more experience
points by killing monsters and more gold by selling the loot they drop.
     Next, the six physical statistics.  You already know that higher is 
better, and you can learn more about them by reading the help file 
"abilattr.txt".  Learn about specialty abilities by reading the help file
"specialt.txt".
     Near the bottom, you will see your armor class, hit points, and (for 
most classes) your spell points.  Armor class shields you from direct damage.  
Hit points are your life wrapped up in a number, so run from anything that 
drops them too low, too fast.  Most classes also have spell points, or 
magical energy that you can put to work by praying or casting spells.

     Get familiar with some of the commands you have available to you, either
by reading the online help file "cmdlist.txt", or by experimenting, whichever 
you prefer.


--- After this... (assumes a little knowledge of commands) ---

     Okay, time to get playing!  Pick up some flasks of oil, or a sling and some 
shots, and either some armor (If you are a warrior.  Store 2), some arrows (if 
you are a ranger.  Store 1 or 3), or some phase door scrolls (If you are most 
other classes.  Stores 4 or 5).  If you can afford it, get your hands on a 
lantern, because the extra light it provides is very handy. Once you've earned 
a little money, invest in a shovel or a pickaxe, and some potions of Cure Medium 
Wounds.  Now, 'w'ear a torch or your lantern.  The 'O' command allows you to
gain speciality abilities, and to view your race, class, and specialty
abilities.
     See that down staircase '>'?  It's the entrance to the deadly, lucrative
dungeon.  Head down (Once on top of the staircase, type '>').
     Once you do that, you will find yourself in a dungeon of rooms and corri-
dors.  Since you have already wielded a light source, you can see, even if you
are not in a magically lit room.

     If you are a warrior, check to make certain everything you can wear is
on  you, and go monster-hunting.  If you are a spell caster you can
'b'rowse a suitable magic book for a list of spells you can cast.  Cast spells
using either 'p'ray or 'm'agic.  Be very careful when experimenting with
spells, because you haven't many hit points.  If you can't learn spells, or find 
that they aren't doing enough damage, 'v' (throw) your flasks of oil and 'f'ire 
your ammo at monsters (make certain you have a wielded shooter that fires 
whatever you have).  When you get hungry, 'E'at some of the food your character 
started out with.  And one last note:  Buy a scroll of Recall.  Find out what it
does.

Have fun, and keep your eyes peeled for a Phial...
