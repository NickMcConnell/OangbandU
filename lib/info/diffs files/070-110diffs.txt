Changes:

Preserve mode:
- Now on by default.

Specialty changes:
- Specialty Power Siphon reworked: Does not always take effect (1
  chance in 3), mana stolen is based on spell cost and player level,
  mana stolen is drained removed from the monster (beyond the original
  casting cost).
- Specialties Altheletics and Clarity give an 5% boost to hitpoints
  and mana respectively (to improve their late game utility).

New specialty Attunement:
- You may become attuned to rods, wands, and staves when you use them 
  (1 chance in 3).
- When attuned, your skill with that device is doubled and increased
  by 50; this gives much easier activation and more criticals.
- Only one type of rod, wand, or staff may be attuned at a time.
- Easily activated items are never attuned.
- Available to all full spellcasters.

Magic item criticals:
- Added critical activations based on device skill to rods, wands, and
  staves.  Criticals cause double damage/healing.  Reduced most
  offensive rod/wand/staff damage by about 10%.  Criticals included,
  average damage is about the same as before with "Superb" device
  skill.  Worst case averages 90% of old damage; best case (L50 Gnome
  Mage, with max Int, and Attunement) averages 25% more than the old
  damage.

Bebalancing items for the incremental resistance system:
- The following items which previous provided resistance to all four
  of fire/cold/elec/acid, now provide only 1/2 level of resistance to
  those elements:
    Power Dragon Scale Mail
    Shields of Resistance
    Crowns of the Magi
    The Iron Helm of Dor-Lomin
    The Battle Axe of Balli Stonehand
    The War Hammer of Aule
    The Cloak of Valinor
    The Small Leather Shield of the Elements
    The Large Leather Shield of Celegorm
    The Large Metal Shield of Anarion
    Defender weapons
    The Cutlass 'Gondricam'
  The following items have lost one type of resistance:
    The Cloak of Thingol (Acid)
    The Short Bow of Amrod (Cold)
    The Short Bow of Amras (Cold)
    The Amulet of Ingwe (Acid)
    The Shadow Cloak of Luthien (Fire)
  Armor of Resistance is now Armor of Greater Resistance now has a
  native depth of 1000'.  Armor of Lesser Resistance occurs earlier
  but provides only half the protection.
  Armor of Elvenkind is now also native to 1000'.
- Temporary resistance now provides 1.5X the bonus of normal
  resistance items (or 2.0X with Enhance Magic).  This is down from
  2.0X (or 2.5X with Enhance Magic).

Dungeon item quantity reduction:
- Reduced all drops by 1/3.
- Reduced big drops by up to another 3X, but gave them a object
  generation level boost.
- Changed some drop flags to accomodate this all.
- Monsters with are native to shallower levels have an increased
  chance of dropping gold, even if they normally drop only items.
  [Similar to Sangband].
- To to compensate for the increased gold chance, shallow monsters may
  sometimes get a boost to item generation level.
- Increased the chances of "good" item enchantments my 5%.
- Reduced the chances of items being dropped below thier native depth.
  This is gradual effect.

Other item changes:
- Added "strong squelch" option under the gameplay menu.  Causes
  squelched items to be quietly destroyed rather than tagged for user
  destruction.
- The following now have the EASY_ACT flag making them much easier to
  activate with lower magic device skill:
    Weapons: Whip of the Balrog, Taratol, Eriril
    Missile Weapons: Harad, Buckland
    Armor: Soulkeeper, Belegennon, Caspanion
    Dragon Scale Mail: All (including artifacts)
    Shields: Earendil
    Helms: Holhenneth
    Boots: Feanor, Gimli
    Lights: All artifacts (including Stone of Lore)
    Amulets: Escaping, the Lion, Boromir, Faramir
    Rings: Tulkas
    Staves: Perception, Light, Dungeon Mapping, Treasure Location
        Object Location, Trap Location, Door/Stain Location,
        Detect Invisible, Detect Evil, Speed, Detection
    Rods: Trap Location, Door/Stair Location, Perception,
        Illumination, Sense Surroundings, Speed
- Fake artifact names now override the standard names more fully,
  including artifact and ego names (Sangband).
- Reduced the rarity of Raal's Tome of Destruction, Spirit of Yavanna,
  Wrath of God, and Necronomicon from 4 to 2.
- "Holy Avenger" Ego items now have a native depth of 1000'.
- Powered up many melee weapons, particular heavy ones (based on
  suggestions from Atriel).
- Melee weapons with randomly increased damage nice are generally less
  powerful.

Ranged combat changes:
- Missile launcher flags now apply to ranged combat [Steamband].
- Replaced Cubragol activation with Fire Brand.
- Infrastructure changes for special shot/throw modes [Steamband
  inspired], and for spells with casting time based on
  shooting/throwing speed.
- Added Archery spells:
  Ranger: Deadeye Shot (Call of the Wild)
    Added accuracy
  Ranger: Scourging Shot (Communion with Nature)
    Slay Orc and Troll
  Ranger: Rain of Arrows (Communion with Nature)
    Arrow splits 3-5 times for 50% damage each, may spread at distance
  Ranger: Storm Shot (Gifts of Nature)
    Lightning Brand + Thunderclap on impact
  Ranger: Dragonslayer (Melian's Lore)
    Slay Dragon
  Assassin: Vile Dart (Mysteries of Angmar)
    Black Breath
  Assassin: Poison Shot (Mysteries of Angmar)
    Poison Brand
  Rogue: Stone Volley (Tensers Transformations)
    Shot splits 3-5 times for 50% damage each, may spread at distance
- Boosted the damage of basic shots, arrows, and bolts.  Reduced the
  bonus from enhanced damage dice on all ammo.
- Thrown items other than throwing weapons may break on a missed attack.
- Changed the quiver to "ready missile weapons" - throwing weapons may
  now be quivered.  Throwing weapons each take the quiver space of 5
  units of ammunition.  Throwing weapons with activation WILL recharge
  in the quiver, but will not provide other bonuses such as resists.

Player magic changes:
- Removed the "spells learned" mechanic completely.  All spells up to
  the player's level are castable.  There is still an experience bonus
  for the first casting of any spell.
- Spell level boosts from various specialties are reflected in the
  color of the max mana display.
- Added two dice to the Druid Poison Bolt spell.
- Weakened the Priest's big "Healing" spell (500 points, was 700; 50
  mana was 40).
- Added "Purifying Strike" to the Priest spellbook Purifications and
  Healing.  This is a a reliable, moderate damage, single target
  attack at a fairly high mana cost.

Added savefile handling patch adapted from Darkgod by Leon Marrick
with the following changes:
- Cleaned up UI to make it more "Angbandy" - names are displayed in a
  vertical scrolling list.
- Character names are displayed now rather than savefile names.
- Savefile names need not match character names for the UI to work properly.
- When creating new characters, savefile names are altered if needed
  to avoid overwriting an existing savefile.  It is impossible to
  overwrite an existing savefile by creating a characer with a similar
  name.
- Any number of characters may have the same name.
- Massive numbers of unneeded refreshes are removed.
- The menu is used by default.
- Some code cleanup.
- When creating a character from a dead savefile, an option is
  provided to reuse the savefile or generate a new one.  There is an
  in-game option to override this behavior and always reuse the
  savefile.

Other UI changes:
- Added targetting path display from NPPangband.
- Added the '.' option to target closest monster in interactive
  targetting [Sangband].
- Items with the autopickup inscription (=g) will now be equiped to
  the quiver automatically if possible.
- Adopted Sangband pickup code, and some related disturbance code.
- Added a new choice in the item selection interface: '#' now selects
  the first eligible item, prioritizing equipment, then inventory,
  then floor.  This is primarily itended to make identifying multiple
  items faster, especially with macros.
- Player symbol changes color with damage take (from NPP).
- Partially switched to EyAngband style "~" info screens.

Monster changes:
- Monster Black Breath: Easier to inflict (with Prepare Black Breath
  and Vile Dart), causes a small increase damage taken and mana used
  by the monster.  Still inhibits monster healing of damage and status
  effects.
- Monster "ADD_MANA" spell ("gathers its power") is more effective
  when the monster is at less than 10% of max mana.  This prevents
  some wierdness in late game monsters vs the Mana Burn specialty
  which made regaining mana a strictly bad thing to do.
- Gothmog gained the tunneling ability.

Miscellaneous balance changes:
- Greatly improved mana regen and slighly improved health regen for
  low level character only.
- Sightly increased poison effect from low level poison attacks.
- Teleport away effects are now "bolts" rather than "beams" - they
  affect only one target.

Code cleanup:
- Moved chest drop information p_chest.txt
- Moved magic information p_magic.txt
- Changed some checks on TV_DRUID_BOOK to SP_WOODSMAN
- Various code cleanup changes by Christer Nyfalt

Bugs fixed (partial list):
- Item letters in the home do not color code.
- Vulnerability of Shadow Fairies to light and Ents to fire is not
  merged with the new resistance systems yet (gives a fixed 1/3 damage
  increase, not displayed).
- Grammatical error in weapons of *Slay* Orc.
- No cursed ego items are generated.
- Dimension Door and Tap Magical Energy should not use mana/time if
  cancelled.  Rod of Portals should not discharge if cancelled.
- Starting priests get a Potion of Naivety rather than Healing.
- Memory of monster summoning spells is not saved.
- Priests do no get their intrinsic Protection from Evil at level 50.
- Holy Light melee attacks do not update monster memory.
- Melee bonuses/penalties based on weapon weight are corrupted for
  many classes.
- Scrolls of teleport level do not work for characters with Phasewalking.
