The files in this folder provide information on debug commands and explain how 
to edit *_info.txt files.  Reading either file may (or may not) spoil your 
enjoyment of the game, and will certainly alter your Angband/Oangband experience 
permanently.

Now that you've been fairly warned, you may decide which appeals to you more:  
Knowledge and control, or a game with hidden secrets and wonderful surprises.  
Choose: you cannot have both.
